# Emotion Detection using YOLOv12

This project contains two main parts:

1. **Model Training in Google Colab**
2. **Face Detection Web App using Streamlit**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training (Colab Notebook)

* The file `Emotion_detection_using_YOLOv12.ipynb` contains the full training process.
* It uses a custom dataset from **Roboflow Universe** for face and emotion detection.
* The model is trained using **YOLOv12** (from Ultralytics) with proper annotation and evaluation.
* Final model is saved as `face.pt`.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Web App (`app.py`)

* The `app.py` file is a **Streamlit app** that loads the trained `face.pt` model.
* http://localhost:8501/
* It allows users to:

  * Upload an image
  * Detect faces and emotions
  * View bounding boxes with confidence and labels
* The app uses **OpenCV**, **Pillow**, and **Ultralytics YOLO**.
